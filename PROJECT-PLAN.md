## Critical Path Items
These must be completed in order:

1. **Basic lead form** â†’ Without this, no lead generation
2. **Strapi setup** â†’ Enables content management
3. **Admin authentication** â†’ Required for dashboard access
4. **Lead management** â†’ Core business functionality

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database choice**: Start with PostgreSQL locally, migrate to Supabase later
- **Email delivery**: Use console.log initially, add SendGrid in Phase 4
- **File storage**: Use local storage first, migrate to Cloudinary in Phase 4

### Business Risks
- **Content availability**: Use placeholder content, replace when ready
- **Multi-language**: Start with English only, add translations later
- **Complex features**: Launch simple, enhance iteratively

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [x] Landing page loads in < 3 seconds âœ…
- [ ] Form submission works on mobile (pending form implementation)
- [ ] At least 1 test lead captured (pending form implementation)

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

- [ ] API response time < 200ms
- [ ] Zero frontend breaking changes

3. Any blockers or concerns?

## Weekly Review Checklist

## Contingency Plans

### If behind schedule:
1. Defer Phase 4 optimizations

3. Use basic email instead of SendGrid
4. Skip analytics dashboard initially
